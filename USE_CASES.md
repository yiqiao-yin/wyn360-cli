---

## 🤖 Intelligent File Operation Handling (NEW in v0.2.1)

WYN360 now includes advanced intelligence for understanding user intent when working with files, automatically determining whether to create new files or update existing ones.

### Intent Recognition

The agent analyzes your natural language to understand what you want:

**Update Existing Files** - When you say:
- "Add feature to my app"
- "Update the chatbot"
- "Improve my script"
- "Modify the config"
- "Change the API endpoint"

**Action taken:**
1. Agent reads the existing file first to understand current state
2. Makes the requested modifications
3. Writes back with `overwrite=True`
4. Shows you what changed

**Create New Files** - When you say:
- "Create a new script called utils.py"
- "Make another chatbot"
- "Build a separate module"
- "Generate a helper file"

**Action taken:**
1. Agent creates the new file
2. Uses `overwrite=False` to prevent accidents
3. Leaves existing files untouched

### Context-Aware Updates

**Before updating any file, the agent:**
1. ✓ Reads the current file contents
2. ✓ Understands the existing structure
3. ✓ Makes intelligent modifications
4. ✓ Preserves what shouldn't change
5. ✓ Explains what was updated

**Example:**
```
You: Add a feature to run hello_world.py when user asks

WYN360:
1. Reading your current app.py...
2. Creating hello_world.py...
3. Updating app.py with new functionality...
✓ Created: hello_world.py
✓ Updated: app.py (added script execution feature)
```

### Self-Correcting Behavior

If the agent makes a wrong choice, it can self-correct:

**Scenario:**
- Agent tries to create file but it already exists
- Gets clear error: "File exists. Use overwrite=True to update"
- Automatically retries with correct settings (up to 3 retries)
- Succeeds on retry

**Benefits:**
- No more "max retries exceeded" errors
- Agent learns from mistakes
- Seamless user experience
- Natural language understanding

### Smart Retry Mechanism

**Configuration:** 3 retries for tool operations

**How it works:**
1. First attempt based on intent recognition
2. If error occurs, analyzes the error message
3. Adjusts parameters (e.g., sets overwrite=True)
4. Retries with corrected parameters
5. Repeats up to 3 times

**This handles:**
- File existence conflicts
- Permission issues
- Temporary failures
- Ambiguous user requests

---

WYN360: [Haiku handles this easily - saves money]

You: Now help me redesign the database schema
You: /model opus

WYN360: [Switches to Opus for complex architectural decision]
```

**Strategy 2: Use Sonnet for most work, Haiku for repetitive tasks**
```
You: /model sonnet

You: Add error handling to api.py
WYN360: [Sonnet provides good code quality]

You: /model haiku

You: Run git status
You: List files in tests directory
You: Show me config.json
WYN360: [Haiku handles these simple operations cheaply]
```

**Strategy 3: Model selection by session type**

**Exploration sessions (Haiku):**
- Understanding new codebase
- Reading files
- Running git commands
- Simple searches

**Development sessions (Sonnet - default):**
- Writing new features
- Refactoring code
- Debugging issues
- General coding

**Architecture sessions (Opus):**
- System design
- Complex refactoring
- Performance optimization
- Critical bug fixes

**Real-World Cost Comparison:**

```
Scenario: Adding a new feature (10 interactions)

With Haiku only:
  - 15K input tokens × $0.25/M = $0.004
  - 8K output tokens × $1.25/M = $0.010
  - Total: $0.014

With Sonnet (default):
  - 15K input tokens × $3.00/M = $0.045
  - 8K output tokens × $15.00/M = $0.120
  - Total: $0.165

With Opus:
  - 15K input tokens × $15.00/M = $0.225
  - 8K output tokens × $75.00/M = $0.600
  - Total: $0.825

Optimized (mixed):
  - 3 simple tasks with Haiku: $0.004
  - 5 coding tasks with Sonnet: $0.083
  - 2 complex tasks with Opus: $0.165
  - Total: $0.252 (saves 69% vs all Opus, better quality than all Haiku)
```

**Command-Line Model Selection:**

You can also set the model when starting WYN360:
```bash
# Start with Haiku for quick tasks
wyn360 --model haiku

# Start with Opus for complex work
wyn360 --model opus

# Use full model ID
wyn360 --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

**Pro Tips:**
- ✅ Use `/model` without arguments to check current model and costs
- ✅ Switch models freely - conversation history is preserved
- ✅ Start sessions with cheaper models, upgrade when needed
- ✅ Use Haiku for file operations and git commands
- ✅ Use Opus sparingly for genuinely complex architectural decisions
- ✅ Monitor costs with `/tokens` command
- ⚠️ Model switches only affect future requests, not past ones

## 📁 Smart File Handling

### Automatic Code Saving

When you're in a **blank project** (no Python or text files), WYN360 automatically saves generated code:

**Process:**
1. Detects Python code blocks in responses (using ``` regex)
2. Extracts the code
3. Suggests appropriate filename based on content
4. Saves automatically
5. Confirms with message: `✓ Code saved to: filename.py`

**Filename Detection Logic:**
```python
if 'streamlit' in code:
    filename = 'app.py'
elif 'fastapi' in code or 'FastAPI' in code:
    filename = 'app.py'
elif 'def main' in code:
    filename = 'main.py'
elif 'class ' in code:
    filename = 'main.py'
else:
    filename = 'script.py'
```

### File Type Recognition

WYN360 categorizes files to understand your project:

| Category | Extensions | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Python | `.py` | Source code |
| Text | `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst` | Documentation |
| Config | `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg` | Configuration |
| Other | All others | Resources, data, etc. |

- Refine step by step
- Build incrementally

### 4. Use in Combination with IDE
- Generate code with WYN360
- Refine in your IDE
- Use IDE for complex refactoring
- Use WYN360 for quick generation

### 5. Review Generated Code
- Always read generated code
- Understand what it does
- Test before deploying
- Customize as needed

### 6. Use Clear Intent Language
- Say "add feature" or "update" when modifying existing files
- Say "create new" or "make another" for new files
- Be explicit about what you want to change
- The agent understands natural language intent

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add authentication to my app" (updates existing)
- ✅ "Create a new helper module" (creates new)
- ✅ "Improve error handling" (updates existing)
- ✅ "Build a separate API client" (creates new)

### 7. Manage Context with Slash Commands (NEW in v0.2.8)
- Use `/tokens` to monitor API costs during long sessions
- Use `/save` to preserve important conversations for later
- Use `/load` to continue previous work sessions
- Use `/clear` when starting fresh to reduce token usage
- Use `/history` to review what you've discussed

**Example Workflow:**
```
You: Build a data analysis pipeline
WYN360: [Creates initial pipeline]

You: Add visualization features
WYN360: [Enhances the pipeline]

You: /tokens
[Token Usage Statistics]
Total Cost: $0.03

You: /save my_pipeline_session.json
✓ Session saved

[Later...]
You: /load my_pipeline_session.json
✓ Session loaded (conversation history restored)

You: Add export to Excel feature
WYN360: [Continues from where you left off with full context]
```

**Cost Management Tips:**
- Check `/tokens` regularly to track spending
- Use `/clear` after completing a major feature to reset context
- Save sessions before clearing to preserve your work
- Long conversations cost more due to conversation history in each API call
- Balance between context (better results) and cost (fewer tokens)

## Use Case 12: Configuration & Personalization

**Feature:** User and project-specific configuration files (v0.3.1)

**Problem:** Every developer has different preferences and every project has unique requirements. Repeating instructions manually is tedious.

**Solution:** WYN360 supports two levels of configuration:
1. **User Config** (`~/.wyn360/config.yaml`) - Your personal preferences across all projects
2. **Project Config** (`.wyn360.yaml`) - Project-specific settings and context

### Configuration Levels

#### User Configuration (~/.wyn360/config.yaml)

```yaml
# Personal preferences that apply to all projects
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
max_tokens: 4096
temperature: 0.7

# Custom instructions for all your work
custom_instructions: |
  - Always use type hints in Python
  - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
  - Add comprehensive docstrings
  - Include error handling

# Quick command aliases
aliases:
  test: "run pytest tests/ -v"
  lint: "run ruff check ."
  format: "run ruff format ."

# Your workspace directories
workspaces:
  - ~/projects
  - ~/work
```

#### Project Configuration (.wyn360.yaml)

```yaml
# Project-specific context - helps AI understand your codebase
context: |
  This is a FastAPI web application with:
  - PostgreSQL database (SQLAlchemy ORM)
  - Redis for caching and session management
  - Celery for background tasks
  - JWT authentication
  - RESTful API design

  dev: "uvicorn app.main:app --reload"
  test: "pytest tests/ -v --cov"
  migrate: "alembic upgrade head"

# Override model for this project (optional)
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022  # Use faster model for simple project
```

### Configuration Priority

Configurations merge with this precedence (highest to lowest):
1. **Project config** (`.wyn360.yaml` in current directory)
2. **User config** (`~/.wyn360/config.yaml`)
3. **Default values**

### Example Workflows

#### Workflow 1: Setting Up User Preferences

```bash
# First time setup - create default user config
$ wyn360

WYN360:
No user config found. Create one with:
~/.wyn360/config.yaml

# After creating config:
$ wyn360

• Loaded user config from: /home/user/.wyn360/config.yaml
• Custom instructions loaded
✓ Connected using model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

#### Workflow 2: Project-Specific Context

```yaml
# Create .wyn360.yaml in your project root
context: |
  This is a machine learning project that:
  - Trains sentiment analysis models
  - Uses PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers
  - Processes large text datasets
  - Requires GPU for training

dependencies:
  - pytorch
  - transformers
  - datasets
  - scikit-learn

commands:
  train: "python train.py --config config.yaml"
  evaluate: "python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best"
```

**When you run wyn360 in this directory:**
```
$ wyn360

• Loaded user config from: ~/.wyn360/config.yaml
• Loaded project config from: .wyn360.yaml
• Custom instructions loaded
• Project context loaded
✓ Connected using model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

You: Help me implement a new transformer model

WYN360: I see you're working on a sentiment analysis project with PyTorch
and Transformers. Let me help you implement a new model that integrates with
your existing training pipeline...
[AI now understands your project context automatically!]
```

#### Workflow 3: Viewing Current Configuration

```
You: /config

Current Configuration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Model                   claude-sonnet-4-20250514
Max Tokens              4096
Temperature             0.7
─────────────────────────────────────────────
User Config             ~/.wyn360/config.yaml
Project Config          .wyn360.yaml
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Custom Instructions     - Always use type hints...
Project Context         This is a FastAPI project...
Dependencies            fastapi, sqlalchemy, redis (+2 more)
Aliases                 test, lint, format

Tip: Create ~/.wyn360/config.yaml for user settings
Tip: Create .wyn360.yaml in project root for project settings
```

### Benefits

**1. Consistency Across Projects**
- Same code style and conventions everywhere
- No need to repeat preferences

**2. Team Collaboration**
- Share `.wyn360.yaml` in git repo
- Everyone gets same project context
- New team members onboard faster

**3. Project-Specific Intelligence**
- AI understands your tech stack
- More relevant code suggestions
- Better architecture decisions

**4. Time Savings**
- No repeating "use type hints" every time
- No explaining project structure repeatedly
- Quick command aliases

### Real-World Example

**Scenario:** You're a Python developer who always uses type hints and works on multiple projects (FastAPI, Django, ML).

**Setup:**

1. **User Config** (`~/.wyn360/config.yaml`):
```yaml
custom_instructions: |
  - Always use type hints
  - Add docstrings to all functions
  - Follow PEP 8
  - Prefer pathlib over os.path

aliases:
  test: "run pytest tests/ -v"
  lint: "run ruff check ."
```

2. **FastAPI Project** (`.wyn360.yaml`):
```yaml
context: |
  FastAPI REST API with PostgreSQL
dependencies: [fastapi, sqlalchemy, pydantic]
commands:
  dev: "uvicorn app:app --reload"
```

3. **ML Project** (`.wyn360.yaml`):
```yaml
context: |
  PyTorch deep learning project
dependencies: [torch, transformers, scikit-learn]
commands:
  train: "python train.py"
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Use more capable model
```

**Result:** When you work in the FastAPI project, the AI knows about FastAPI and REST APIs. When you switch to the ML project, it knows about PyTorch and transformers. Both use your personal preferences (type hints, docstrings, etc.).

### Tips

**Best Practices:**
1. ✅ Keep user config for personal preferences
2. ✅ Keep project config for project-specific context
3. ✅ Commit `.wyn360.yaml` to git (helps team)
4. ✅ Use project config to specify tech stack
5. ❌ Don't put API keys in config files
6. ❌ Don't make configs too verbose

**Pro Tips:**
- Use `/config` command to verify your settings
- Use project config for complex projects (5+ files)
- Update project context as your project evolves
- Share project config in README for team alignment

## Use Case 13: Streaming Responses

**Feature:** Real-time token-by-token streaming (v0.3.2)

**Problem:** Waiting for entire responses can feel slow, especially for long code generations or explanations. Users want immediate feedback.

**Solution:** WYN360 now streams responses token-by-token as they're generated, providing instant visual feedback and a more responsive experience.

### Before Streaming (Old Behavior)

```
You: Generate a large Python script for data analysis

[Spinner animation for 10-15 seconds]

WYN360: [Entire response appears at once after waiting]
```

**User Experience:**
- ❌ Long wait with no feedback
- ❌ Feels slow and unresponsive
- ❌ Can't see progress
- ❌ Can't start reading early parts

### After Streaming (New Behavior)

```
You: Generate a large Python script for data analysis

WYN360: I'll create a comprehensive data analysis script...

[Text appears word-by-word as it's generated]

Let me build this step by step:

1. First, import the necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
...
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Immediate feedback
- ✅ Feels fast and responsive
- ✅ See progress in real-time
- ✅ Start reading while streaming

### Benefits

**1. Faster Perceived Response Time**
- Even though total time is the same, streaming feels much faster
- Immediate feedback creates sense of progress
- Similar to ChatGPT's streaming experience

**2. Better UX for Long Responses**
- Start reading documentation while it generates
- Review code as it appears
- Understand context before completion

**3. Transparency**
- See exactly what the AI is generating
- Can stop if going in wrong direction
- Better sense of AI "thinking" process

### Example Workflows

#### Workflow 1: Long Code Generation

```
You: Create a FastAPI application with authentication, database models,
     and CRUD endpoints for a blog system

WYN360: I'll create a complete FastAPI blog application...

Let me structure this into several files:

1. **app/main.py** - Main application entry point
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
...
[Code streams in real-time]
```

2. **app/models.py** - Database models
...
[Continues streaming]
```

**Experience:** You can start reading the main.py code while models.py is still being generated.

#### Workflow 2: Documentation and Explanations

```
You: Explain how asyncio works in Python with examples

WYN360: Asyncio is Python's library for writing concurrent code...

[Explanation streams word-by-word]

Here's how it works:

1. **Event Loop**: The core of asyncio...
2. **Coroutines**: Functions defined with async def...
3. **Tasks**: Wrapped coroutines that run concurrently...

[You can read section 1 while sections 2-3 are still generating]
```

#### Workflow 3: Large Script Generation

**Before (Non-Streaming):**
```
You: Generate a comprehensive data pipeline script

[Wait 15 seconds with spinner]

WYN360: [500 lines of code appear instantly]
[Overwhelming - hard to parse all at once]
```

**After (Streaming):**
```
You: Generate a comprehensive data pipeline script

WYN360: I'll create a data pipeline with these components:
[Starts streaming immediately]

# Step 1: Data ingestion
[Code appears line-by-line]

# Step 2: Data transformation
[Code continues streaming]

# Step 3: Data validation
[More code streams in]

[You're already reading Step 1 while Step 3 is being generated]
```

### Technical Details

**How It Works:**
- Uses pydantic-ai's streaming API
- Tokens are yielded as they're generated by Claude
- Rich console displays them immediately
- Full response is accumulated for history

**Performance:**
- **No slowdown**: Streaming adds no latency
- **Same total time**: Response completes at same time
- **Better perception**: Feels 2-3x faster due to immediate feedback

### Comparison

| Aspect | Non-Streaming | Streaming |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **First Token** | 10-15s wait | Instant |
| **Perceived Speed** | Slow | Fast |
| **Reading Start** | After completion | Immediately |
| **Progress Feedback** | None | Real-time |
| **User Experience** | Waiting | Engaging |

### Use Cases Where Streaming Shines

**1. Documentation Generation**
```
You: Document this module with detailed docstrings

WYN360: [Streams documentation as it writes]
# You can read early functions while later ones generate
```

**2. Code Refactoring**
```
You: Refactor this 500-line script

WYN360: [Shows refactored code streaming]
# Review changes as they happen, not all at once
```

**3. Explanations and Tutorials**
```
You: Explain design patterns with examples

WYN360: [Explanation streams naturally]
# Read and understand each pattern before next one generates
```

**4. Large File Generation**
```
You: Create a complete API client with all endpoints

WYN360: [Streams code file by file]
# Start planning implementation while rest generates
```

### Tips

**Pro Tips:**
- Streaming is automatic - no configuration needed
- Works for all response types (code, text, explanations)
- Conversation history is preserved normally
- Same quality as non-streaming responses

## 15. Performance Monitoring & Analytics

Monitor your CLI usage, response times, tool efficiency, and identify performance bottlenecks with comprehensive metrics tracking.

### What is Performance Monitoring?

WYN360 automatically tracks and analyzes session performance, providing insights into:
- **Response Times**: How fast the AI responds to your requests
- **Tool Usage**: Which tools you use most and their success rates
- **Error Tracking**: What errors occur and how frequently
- **Session Statistics**: Overall session duration and activity

### The /stats Command

View comprehensive performance metrics at any time during your session:

```
You: /stats

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓  ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃   Token Usage        ┃  ┃   Performance Metrics   ┃

```

### Use Case 1: Identifying Slow Operations

**Scenario:** You notice your session feels slow sometimes

```
You: /stats

WYN360: [Shows metrics]
- Avg Response: 4.5s
- Max Response: 15.2s  ← Outlier detected!

You: What took 15 seconds?

WYN360: Looking at your session history, the slowest
operation was "Generate comprehensive ML pipeline" which
generated 800+ lines of code. Consider breaking large
requests into smaller chunks for faster responses.
```

**Insight:** Large code generation requests take longer. Break them into smaller, focused tasks.

### Use Case 2: Tool Success Rate Analysis

**Scenario:** Want to see which operations are failing

```
You: /stats

WYN360: [Shows tool usage]
Tool Success Rates:
- read_file: 100% (15/15)
- write_file: 92.3% (12/13)  ← 1 failure
- execute_command: 100% (8/8)
- git_status: 83.3% (5/6)    ← 1 failure

You: Why did write_file fail once?

WYN360: The write_file failure was due to attempting
to write without overwrite=True when the file already
existed. This was corrected in the retry.
```

**Insight:** Understand which operations need error handling or user confirmation.

### Use Case 3: Session Cost Monitoring

**Scenario:** Track spending during a long coding session

```
You: I've been working for 2 hours. How much have I spent?

You: /stats

WYN360: [Shows combined token + performance metrics]
Session Duration: 2h 15m
Total Requests: 47
Total Cost: $1.23
Average Cost per Request: $0.026

Most expensive operations:
1. Multi-file refactoring: $0.15
2. Test generation: $0.12
3. Documentation creation: $0.09
```

**Insight:** Monitor costs in real-time, identify expensive operations, optimize usage.

### Use Case 4: Error Tracking & Debugging

**Scenario:** Encountering errors and want to understand patterns

```
You: /stats

WYN360: [Shows error summary]
Error Count: 3
Error Types:
- FileNotFoundError: 2
- ValueError: 1

Recent errors:
1. FileNotFoundError: "config.yaml not found" (2x)
2. ValueError: "Invalid JSON format"

You: Create config.yaml with default settings

WYN360: ✓ Created config.yaml
Now future runs won't encounter FileNotFoundError
```

**Insight:** Identify recurring errors and fix root causes.

### Use Case 5: Performance Benchmarking

**Scenario:** Compare different models or approaches

```
# Session 1 with Haiku (fast model)
You: /stats
Avg Response: 1.2s
Total Cost: $0.15

# Session 2 with Sonnet (balanced model)
You: /stats
Avg Response: 2.3s
Total Cost: $0.42

# Session 3 with Opus (powerful model)
You: /stats
Avg Response: 4.1s
Total Cost: $1.25
```

**Insight:** Choose the right model for your use case - speed vs. capability vs. cost.

### Features

**Automatic Tracking:**
- ✅ Response times tracked for every request
- ✅ Tool calls logged with success/failure status
- ✅ Errors captured with type and message
- ✅ Session duration calculated automatically

**Persistent Metrics:**
- ✅ Metrics saved with /save command
- ✅ Loaded with /load command
- ✅ Track performance across multiple sessions

**Zero Configuration:**
- ✅ Works automatically - no setup required
- ✅ Non-intrusive - runs in background
- ✅ No performance overhead
- ✅ Compatible with all existing features

### Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/stats` | Show comprehensive performance metrics | `You: /stats` |
| `/tokens` | Show only token usage (legacy) | `You: /tokens` |
| `/clear` | Reset all metrics and history | `You: /clear` |

### Tips for Optimization

**1. Monitor Long-Running Sessions**
```bash
# Check metrics periodically during long sessions
You: /stats
# If avg response time > 5s, consider:
# - Breaking large requests into smaller ones
# - Switching to faster model (haiku)
# - Clearing conversation history
```

**2. Track Tool Efficiency**
```bash
# If tool success rate < 90%, investigate:
# - Are file paths correct?
# - Do required files exist?
# - Are permissions set properly?
```

**3. Cost Management**
```bash
# Set personal budget limits
# Check /stats before expensive operations
# Use haiku for simple tasks, sonnet for complex
```

**4. Identify Bottlenecks**
```bash
# Look at "Most Used Tools"
# If one tool dominates, consider:
# - Batch operations
# - Cache results
# - Optimize workflow
```

### Real-World Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Building a web scraper project

```
# Start session
You: Create a web scraper for news articles

# After 30 minutes of work
You: /stats

WYN360:
Session Duration: 32m
Total Requests: 18
Avg Response: 2.1s
Total Cost: $0.45

Most Used Tools:
- write_file: 8 times (100% success)
- read_file: 6 times (100% success)
- execute_command: 4 times (75% success)  ← Attention needed

You: Why did execute_command fail?

WYN360: One pip install failed due to network timeout.
Retried successfully. No action needed.

# Continue working...

# End of session
You: /stats

WYN360:
Final Session Stats:
Duration: 1h 15m
Requests: 35
Cost: $0.87
Success Rate: 97.1%

You: /save scraper_session.json
WYN360: ✓ Session saved (including performance metrics)
```

**Result:** Complete project visibility, cost tracking, and session replay capability.

### Technical Details

**What's Tracked:**
- Request timestamps and durations
- Tool invocation counts (success/failure)
- Error occurrences with stack traces
- Token usage per request
- Model information

**Storage:**
- In-memory during session
- Persisted to JSON with /save
- Loaded from JSON with /load
- Zero database dependencies

**Performance:**
- Negligible overhead (< 0.1ms per operation)
- Asynchronous tracking
- Memory efficient
- No blocking operations
